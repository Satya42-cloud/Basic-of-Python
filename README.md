## Python Coding Exercises
This repository contains solutions to a series of Python programming exercises designed to demonstrate fundamental coding skills and problem-solving techniques. Each exercise is implemented with attention to clarity, efficiency, and best practices. The exercises cover various concepts including number theory, random number generation, list manipulation, text processing, and string operations.

### 1. Prime Numbers
- Objective: Develop a Python program to determine if a given number is prime.
- Description: A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 with no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The program implements an efficient algorithm 
  to check primality.
### 2. Product of Random Numbers
- Objective: Create a Python program to generate two random numbers and verify the userâ€™s input for their product.
- Description: The program generates two random numbers, prompts the user to input their product, and checks if the provided answer is correct, displaying an appropriate 
  message based on the result.
### 3. Squares of Even/Odd Numbers
- Objective: Write a Python script to calculate and print the squares of even or odd numbers within the range of 100 to 200.
- Description: The script is designed to handle either even or odd numbers as specified in the code comments. It iterates through the range and computes the squares, 
  demonstrating control flow and loop operations.
### 4. Word Counter
- Objective: Develop a Python program to count the number of occurrences of each word in a given text.
- Description: The program processes an input text and outputs the frequency of each word. It handles punctuation and whitespace, ensuring accurate word counts.
### 5. Check for Palindrome
- Objective: Implement a function to check if a given string is a palindrome.
- Description: The is_palindrome function evaluates whether the input string reads the same forwards and backwards, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. The 
  function returns True for palindromes and False otherwise.
